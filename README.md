# Matthies' Portfolio

## Project Description

This project is a portfolio website for myself **(Matthies Abera)** as a contact point for potential workplace's to reach me as well as to showcase all current and past projects I have worked on in one concise and condensed location.

The tech stack used was Next JS (front-end) and SQL (back-end).

Additionally, I opted to create as many componnents from scratch over importing from the already available librarieis to further develop and hone my skills in front-end development.

## Installation / Start / Testing

First, run the development server:

```bash
build: npm run build
execute: npm run dev
test: npm run test
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `/src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Possible Extension Features

1. Create a database and migrate all mocked data to it.
2. Create a modal pane upon contact form submission.
3. Rework Navigation Bar or Contact components.
